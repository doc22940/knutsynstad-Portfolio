		h3 Description
		p Every year, the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/">United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a> spends millions of dollars predicting national crop production throughout the growing season. Helped by thousands, they sample farms, by hand, in a portion of the 3,242 counties. Their monthly reports move commodity crop marketsâ€”having this information before others provide a significant advantage.

		p In 2015, <a href="http://descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs</a> used public satellites, weather data, and their expertise in distributed supercomputing to make the first entirely automated forecast of national corn production. While the USDA reports at a state and national granularity, Descartes Labs can provide per county predictions. Their prediction came within 1.9% of the actual production, reported by the USDA more than 6 months later.

		p This poster was made to better understand key aspects of corn growth and prediction. It visualizes the 2015 growing season in Polk County, Iowa, and is one of a series. New posters, showing conditions for other counties, can be produced programmatically.
