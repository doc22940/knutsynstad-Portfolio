		h3 Description
		p In this visualization, we examine what Herbert Simon might call the &#8220;solution space&#8221; for tic-tac-toe, a compound visualization of all its solutions&mdash;every legal game move and the connections between them&mdash;in a single artifact.

		p Most of us have played tic-tac-toe. It's a deceptively simple game. Two players claim unique symbols (<code>X</code> or <code>O</code>) before alternating turns in placing their symbol in an empty cell within a 3-by-3 grid. The first player to place 3 of their symbols in a row, either cardinally or diagonally, wins.

		p End conditions are clear; either a player wins, or the game is a draw. The myriad ways of getting there are what makes the game fun. But what does the solution to tic-tac-toe look like? Drawing a single winning combination does not do justice to the complexity of the game.

		p Instead, imagine a map of all possible paths from blank board to finished game. We might call this the &#8220;solution space&#8221; for tic-tac-toe, where each path is but one way to navigate through the space.

		p How large is the solution space? Well, for the first move, there are 9 cells available. For the second, there are 8, and so on. Follow to completion, and we get <code>9&times;8&times;7&times;6&times;5&times;4&times;3&times;2&times;1</code> or <code>9!</code> boards for the final level. For each level <code>n</code> of gameplay, there are <code>9!/(9-n)!</code> boards in total. By adding the level totals together, we get an &#8220;upper bound&#8221; of 986,410 boards&mdash;far too many to represent meaningfully.

		p For the visualization to be meaningful, the number of boards must be reduced. We do this by introducing 3 rules; (1) removing duplicate boards reduces the count to 6,046, (2) removing illegal moves (play after a win) reduces the count to 5,478, and (3) by removing symmetric duplicates (rotational and reflectional) we are left with 765 unique boards. This poster displays them all in a matrix.
