		h3 Description
		p The popularity of video games has increased exponentially over the last decade and in order to keep players interested, game developers keep adding content at a higher level of difficulty to promote competition. Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games are a relatively recent form of gaming that has gained popularity by creating communities around teamwork. Often players are encouraged to band together to overcome challenges, they would not be able to accomplish on their own.
		p This creates a culture of competition to either be the best, the fastest or in some way distinguish themselves from the rest. For some, this even means abandoning conventional lifestyles and dedicating their lives to the pursuit of gaming supremacy. This book explores this subculture of gamers and their willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve their idea of success.
